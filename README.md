# WIP: sax-setup-scraper
scrapes the web for saxophone setups

## usage

install your dependencies:
`npm install`

start the script:
`npm start`

right now the script just scrapes the one site that has a config. I've set it up so that more configs can be added later for more sites.

TODO:
- add a cli element that will allow you to pick a source
